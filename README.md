#### üèó Software

I work as a software developer at [Teufel Audio](http://teufel.de/), and in my free time, I like to contribute
to [OSS](https://chemaclass.es/blog/open-source-software/), such as [Phel](https://github.com/phel-lang/phel-lang)
or [Gacela](https://github.com/gacela-project/gacela).

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Knowledge Sharing

I love writing about stuff, that's why I created a [tech blog](https://chemaclass.es/blog/), and
my [readings blog](https://chemaclass.es/readings/). There I write a post every month about tech, habits, team
behaviors, and everything that I find interesting and brings some value to my life.
