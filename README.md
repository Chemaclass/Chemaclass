#### ‚úçÔ∏è Knowledge Sharing

I enjoy writing about topics that I find exciting and bring some value to my life. That's why I created my [tech blog](https://chemaclass.es/blog/) and my [readings blog](https://chemaclass.es/readings/). There, I write a monthly post about tech, habits, and team behaviors, among other areas.
