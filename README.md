#### ‚úçÔ∏è Knowledge Sharing

I love writing about stuff, that's why I created a [tech blog](https://chemaclass.es/blog/), and
my [readings blog](https://chemaclass.es/readings/). There I write a post every month about tech, habits, team
behaviors, and everything that I find interesting and brings some value to my life.
