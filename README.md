### 🏗 About Me

- 💻 Software developer since **2013**, currently **Tech Lead** at Purpose Green.
- 🛠 I build tools that empower developers—the best code is often the code you don't write.
- 🌱 Always learning, always sharing. Simplicity over complexity, always.

I believe in writing simple, maintainable code and collaborating on meaningful software.

### 🔧 Projects & Contributions

I actively maintain and contribute to:

- [**phel-lang**](https://phel-lang.org) — A functional Lisp that compiles to PHP.
- [**bashunit**](https://bashunit.typeddevs.com/) — A testing library for bash scripts.
- [**gacela**](https://gacela-project.com/) — Build modular PHP applications.

### ✍️ Writing & Knowledge Sharing

I write about technology, team culture, habits, and growth on my [Tech Blog](https://chemaclass.com/blog/) and [Readings Blog](https://chemaclass.com/readings/).
