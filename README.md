#### ‚úçÔ∏è Knowledge Sharing

I enjoy writing about topics that I find exciting and bring some value to my life. 
That is why I created my [tech blog](https://chemaclass.es/blog/) and my [readings blog](https://chemaclass.es/readings/). 
I like to write a monthly post about tech, habits, leadership, team behaviors, among other topics.
