### 🏗 About Me

- 💻 Software developer since **2013**, currently **Tech Lead** at Purpose Green.
- 🛠 I build tools that empower developers—the best code is often the code you don't write.
- 🌱 Always learning, always sharing. Simplicity over complexity, always.

I believe in writing simple, maintainable code and collaborating on meaningful software.
